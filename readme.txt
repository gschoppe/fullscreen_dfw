Enlarge DFW (Distraction-Free Writing) mode to fill the screen's width, giving users a real fullscreen editor.

Full-Width DFW allows you to use the complete width of your browser window for editing in DFW mode.
Simply hit the DFW button, in the upper right corner of the editor, and the editor will expand to fill the width of your window.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. I installed the plugin, and nothing changed.  What gives? =
A. Full-Width Distraction-Free Writing does nothing until you click the DFW button in the WordPress editor.

= Q. Why would you want this? =
A. I often design sites to use a max content area size of 1200px.  On a 1440x900 laptop, that width cannot
be seen in the normal WordPress editor.  If I include my media queries in the editor stylesheet, I can't
preview them live, without a bigger monitor.

= Q. Can I integrate Full-Width DFW in my theme/plugin? =
A. I'd love to see plugin integrations, but reach out to me first, at admin@gschoppe.com. There are some
caveats with integration that I can help you navigate.  For themes, I'd prefer if you list it as a suggested
or required plugin with your theme.  It's always best if there is a single source for updates and improvements

= Q. Why does your editor look so much cooler than mine, in the screenshots? =
A. Stay Tuned ;)

= Q. Your plugin is bad, and you should feel bad! =
A. That's not really a question, but at least our moms like us. Feel free to send your 'constructive criticism'
to admin@gschoppe.com, or leave us a review/rating.
